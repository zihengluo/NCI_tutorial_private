#### What is NCI
Read this:

https://nci.org.au/

### {} steps for starting to use NCI

#### Step 1 Signup

You should register for a new NCI account 

https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/signup/0

You should get a username after providing your information, the username should be consisted of two lower case characters and four numbers.

#### Step 2 Login

Login by using mobaxterm or wsl on window11 (VPN free) 

```
ssh {username}@gadi.nci.org.au
```

#### Step 3 Set up your home 

Each user only have 1 gb space in their home folder, so install a miniconda (looks like already increase to 10 gb)

https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Make your own folder in gdata

```
mkdir -p /g/data/{your project id}/{your user name}
```

You can check your home space by using:

```
quota -s -f /home
```

##### About storage

Gadi has two places to store files, gdata and scratch, available space of /gdata is 3TB, /scratch is 1TB. In principle, files stored in /scratch 


You can check space already used by your project:

```
nci_account -P {your project id}
```

Check how much space does each user in your project used:

scratch :

```
nci-files-report -f scratch --group {your project id}
```

gdata:

```
nci-files-report -f gdata --group {your project id}
```

You can also use this:

```
lquota
```

You may notice when you use 'nci_account -P' to check space already used, you can also get a usage report.

I personally regard KSU as a type of currency, the more you used, the more you will be charged.

For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage Report: Project={} Period=2021.q4 <-----q4 means the 4th quarter

    Grant:    75.00 KSU     <----- total ksu in each quarter

    Used:    40.34 KSU     <----- ksu you have used in this quarter
    
    Reserved:     0.00 SU
    
    Avail:    34.66 KSU     <----- ksu you can use in this quarter


You can check how they charge compute jobs: 
https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/2.+Compute+Grant+and+Job+Debiting

How different types of job queue cost:

https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/2.2+Job+Cost+Examples

Use normal queue in most situations. 

#### Step 4 Write a script for submitting PBS job

NCI already has installed some basic modules, you can check available modules at https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/Gadi+Latest+Software+Update

If the modules you hope to use already be included in this list, you won't need to install them in your conda environment. 

Assume you hope to use a module which already install, write a script like this:
```
#!/bin/bash
#PBS -N Example_Job
#PBS -q {normal/hugemem}
#PBS -l mem={}GB
#PBS -l walltime={}:00:00
#PBS -l jobfs={}GB
#PBS -l ncpus={}
#PBS -l wd
#PBS -l storage=scratch/{project_id}+gdata/{project_id}
#PBS -M {your_email_address}                    <-------if you provide your email address, you will receive a mail if your job exceed memory you requested

set -xue

module load {module}/{module version}

{put your command here}

module unload {module}/{module version}

```


#### Step 5 Submit your job


After you write this script, you can submit it with:

```
qsub {your script}

```
After submission, you will get a job id

Then you can trace your job progress with the job id provided:

```
qstat -fx {job_id}

```

If you forget your job id

```
qstat -u {your user id} -sw

```

Different status of the job status:

Q: waiting

R: running

H: holding, possibly your project doesn't have enough KSU or the job memory you requested exceed

More potential reasons cause your job not running can be found here: https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/FAQ+1%3A+Why+My+Jobs+are+NOT+Running

If your job use memory exceed requested, you might receive email like this:

PBS Job Id: 28860049.gadi-pbs
Job Name:  {}
Job to be deleted at request of root@gadi-cpu-clx-1429.gadi.nci.org.au

Then you should request more memeory and submit this job again


#### Step 6 Submit a interactive job 

Sometime you might need to run interactive job, submit an interactive job will allow you to work on a compute node directly and use NCI like using command line. Only single CPU core, 4 GB memory and 30 minutes running time is allowed on the login node, so submit an interactive job if you want to use node like using command line. 

```
qsub -I -P {project_id} -q {normal/express/hugemem} -l walltime={}:00:00,ncpus={},mem={}GB,jobfs={}GB,storage=gdata/{project_id}+scratch/{project_id},wd

```

Once the interactive job is ready, it will give you a job id and you can see @gadi-login-0x ~ change to @cpu~xxxxx (not quite remember) 

After you finish your work, you can simply type 'quit' to end your interactive job


Remember: interactive jobs will stop once you log out from the login node, keep the window open before finishing your job

#### Some tips 




#### What should I do if my home is full but I still need to create a new conda environment

You can remove some environments you no longer need. You can run this to save these environment settings and create new environments with these config files when you need them.

```
conda env export >{name you like}.yml

```

Create the same environment with the configure file you made:

```
conda env create --name {name you like} -f {your configure file name} 

```



Or

you can create conda environment in another directory (not quite recommend)

For example

```
conda create --prefix {to/the/folder/you/like}

conda activate {to/the/folder/you/like}

```

You can find packages you install in this folder. 



#### Why my job not run (both submitting job and interactive job)



#### How to transfer files between remote servers or local computer



#### Why I can't transfer large files to NCI

Details about transfering files to or from NCI: 

No-interactive job will be killed after 30 minutes, to transfer large files, you can submit a PBS job for transfering.   

For small size files (smaller than around 600 Gb) which will take less than 30 minutes to transfer
```

```



#### 



#### About Singularity 

NCI not allow user to make writable singularity container by using fake-root or sandbox, you can't use mysql.

Singularity image can be big, some files will automatelly save in ./singularity (your home path), which may make you get a error like:

WARNING: mkdir {xxxx}/.singularity: disk quota exceeded

To avoid this error, you can create a folder in scratch then link this folder to the .singularity folder in your home path

```
mkdir -p /scratch/{your project id}/{your username}/.singularity

ln -s /scratch/{your project id}/{your username}/.singularity ${HOME}/.singularity
```

Then you should be able to download singularity image by using 'singularity pull'
